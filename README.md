# layer-2-learn

i was not very fond of defi until recent GameStop incident, cefi looks really horrible now.

ethereum now is slow and expensive, seeing no end. 2.0 may still be years ahead.

so how is layer2 solutions going, tvl, active users, performance, features, how they work, etc.

### matic

### loopring

### zkswap
took a peek, i will not use it personally

1. cant find public source code, implementation contract not verified
2. no timelock, too much power to the dev
